# Ingredients

- 500 grams all-purpose flour
- 6-7 grams active dry yeast
- ¬Ω teaspoon salt
- 250 ml lukewarm water (keep a bit more handy, though)
- 60 ml olive oil
- 1 tbsp unbleached whole cane sugar (you can omit this but it worked well for me)
- (optional) shredded cheese (we use Manchego since we all have digestive issues with cow's milk). Mozzarella or any other higher-saline, easy-to-melt wld work üëç

# First Prep

I use a commercial stand mixer.

- Thoroughly mix yeast and flour in mixer bowl
- In a separate bowl mix salt, water and olive oil
- Combine
- Mix-knead with dough hook on mixer until an elastic ball forms (~5 min). If the dough is try, add tiny amounts of water till it's completely from the sides of the bowl.

Let rest for at least an hour or overnight in the fridge and let it come up to temp. This is not really necessary, but letting the yeast do its job will mean more complex, tasty flavors.

# Second Prep

Some folks use an oiled surface vs floured surface. I like the flour method. YMMV. Reduce olive oil in the ingredients if you end up going the oiled surface route.

- Lightly flour a board and keep flour handy
- Divide dough into 8 balls. Keep the not-in-use balls covered. You can make smaller ones and divide into 10 balls if you want. My teenagers will have none of that, though.
- Press dough flat and shape into a rectangle-ish form with your hands
- For the below, keep dusting _lightly_ with flour for each roll step to help dough not to stick
- Roll the dough out thin. Really thin. Excrutiatingly thin. You're going to fold and roll again, so this is important.
- If filling the flatbread, sprinkle cheese now. YMMV. I never use enough but it's always tasty :-)
- Working veritcally, fold top edge to center and then fold bottom edge to center
- Working horizontally, fold left edge to center and then folkd right edge to center
- Roll out flat again so it fits in a large cast iron pan on griddle plate on an oven
- Put on parchment paper and keep layering parchment & prepared flatbread until done

# Time For Some Heat!

- If using a griddle, heat to ~400¬∞F. If using a big cast iron pan, heat with medium high heat. **NOTE** Adjust this as you see fit if your first flatbread gets singed (lower heat) or doesn't get crispy (raise heat). The temp gauges on home cooking equipment aren't great.
- Using a silicone brush (rated 600+¬∞F) or a homemade olive oil spray, coat the surface _well_ with oil. If you are comfortable using an oil soaked paper towel, do that, but I think it's dangerous and wastes nom oil. You aren't deep frying, but you aren't dry-frying either, so aim for well-coated.
- Cook ~3-ish minutes on each side. They should puff a bit
- Keep warm as they are amazing warm. They are really tasty not warm, too.
