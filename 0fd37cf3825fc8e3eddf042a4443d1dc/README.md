The best way to grab these files is to `git clone` the gist or download it as a ZIP.

If I knew more about French noun constructs I would have tried to do the suffix extraction myself, but it would have probably ended up doing nothing more than proving I'm an uneducated American ;-)

### fr_names.csv

These are all the "place names" in France. The first column is the UTF-8 encoding of the name. The second column is the ASCII encoding of the name. This is from geonames

You'll want to get the [full geonames file](http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/FR.zip) as it has the long/lat of the place name center (which can be used to replicate the example).

### french_surnames.txt

This is a list of the most common French surnames (I am not sure if place names follow one of the German patterns of using family names). This is from http://www.searchforancestors.com/surnames/origin/frenchsurnames.html

### french_suffixes.txt

This is a list of all French suffixes from https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:French_suffixes
