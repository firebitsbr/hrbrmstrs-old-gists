Command-line Twitter timeline reader in R

Save to something like `~/cmdlinescripts/refresh.R`

Set an alias:

    alias timeline="Rscript ~/cmdlinescripts/refresh.R"
    
and just type `timeline` at a prompt when you want to see the last 100 updates in your timeline

Windows folks: feel free to add a comment for how to alias on that platform.
