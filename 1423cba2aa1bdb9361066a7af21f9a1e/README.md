A couple got their 15m of fame by putting the blame on the Amazon Echo for an incident which is their fault.

Amazon's PR incident handling machine did a great job taking the blame (they likely have a top-notch playbook)
but here are 151 headlines with sources and intro snippets pulled from news summaries since Thursday evening. 

Some sources do not have intro snippets and some sources have more than one entry since there were updates or
they were just capitalizing on fear to get clicks for eyeballs.

Wired's headline was the most reasonable. There are a few "honorable" mentions for using qualifiers such as "alleged" or
ensuring there is more of a claim than a fact. I also can't fault the ones who lead with Amazon's admittance (again,
that was excellent PR damage control)

For the most part, the headlines and intro snippets are not nearly as horrible as I expected but many are bad and more than
a few are definitely "fake news".
