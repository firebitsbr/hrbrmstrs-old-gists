Makes 2 loaves

oven: 375°F to 425°F

ingred:

- ~500g bread flour (humidity/etc determine more/less)
- ~8g yeast (1 packet if you do packets; i waver between bulk & packets)
- 12g kosher salt
- 20g turbinado sugar
- ~40g olive oil
- ~340g very warm water

prep:

- mix flour and yeast in a bowl with a whisk for 30-60s
- mix salt+sugar+oil+water in a separate container
- combine with wooden spoon or sturdy spatula

work:

- 10m of kneading any way you like (I use ~5 on low and ~5 on medium in a stand mixer with dough hook)

wait:

- pour a glass of cabernet ;-)
- rise til double (takes an hour up here for some reason)

work:

- separate into 2 even blobs
- shape into rough oblongs

wait:

- cover for 5 mins and let rest

work: 

- working with individual pieces, flatten by hand then roll out into rectangle
- roll up (tight) into a medium length oblong
- pinch and taper bottom seam
- pinch and taper ends
- put on parchemnt, cover with flour towels and repeat for the other 3
- NOTE: you can put these in pullman pans if you have them. that makes it easier for something like sammichs

wait:

- pour another glass of caberenet :-)
- remove towel(s) or whatev you used to cover
- wait for another hour-ish. if using pans, they shld have risen to ~3/4 height

work:

- if using pullman, oil lids and cover with the lids
- put in oven

wait:

- _one more glass_ ;-)
- 30-40 mins in the oven (dep on the temp you used — def do 375° if doing pullman). internal temp thls be ~205-215°F

work:

- if using pullman, get them outta there! :-)
- let cool on racks
