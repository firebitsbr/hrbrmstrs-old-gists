The code in the gist sources this gist and reads a list of "mute" flag words from `mute.txt` and displays the filtered tweets in the RStudio Viewer.

NOTE that you have to have 4 environment variables setup for this to work.

You should probably clone this since I'll be making my own additions to the mute list.

Also it seems to not be heeding the ignore case bit but this was more for fun so i may not get 'round to fixing it.
