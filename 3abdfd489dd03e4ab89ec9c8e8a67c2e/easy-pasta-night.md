ingred prep: 

- 1 large can whole tomatoes (separate liquid from tomatoes then either hand chop for coarser sauce or hand blend/food process for smoother)
– 1 tbsp double-concentrate (it's in a squeezable, resealable tube) tomato paste
- 3 shallots (or equiv volume w/various onions) diced
- garlic (that's totally to individ taste) thin slivers (that lets folks who can't really "do" garlic remove them)
- dried basil/oregano/marjoram/rosemary (experiment with combos and amounts to come up some various mixes that work well for your fam tastes) — you can use non-dried, but dried == always have on hand
- 2 dried or fresh bay leaves
- fresh parsley to taste at the very end
- red/white wine and/ good chicken/beef/veg stock (experimenting to see what works for various combos again)
- decent olive oil (1-3 tbsp dep on how you like your sauce)
- salt (fresh cracked globally sourced rocky salt or morton's coarse kosher)
- pepper (fresh cracked)
- sweetenter to taste if desired (i try to use a gd enough wine to avoid this but use agave to taste)

prep: 

- sautee shallot/onion + garlic (if using) in medium heat olive oil until transparent (not brown)
- if using dried ingredients, then add them now for 1m otherwise wait until tomatoes are in for the fresh ones
- add tomatoes and bay leaves (bring back to temp)
- add wine and/or stock until a thinner volume + taste is reached
- salt & pepper to pre-taste
- simmer for 25m
- re-gauge taste and augment with wine/stock/salt/pepper/sweetener

serve with salad or steamed veg

boom. done.

MIX-IT-UPpers:

- easy meat sauce: brown ground beef/chicken/turkey/pork/veal separately then add in to sauce pan after onion is done but before tomatoes (you'll likely want to change up the spice mix for this)
- meatballs! (i don't tell ppl how to make meatballs since that's usually a great way to get grandmothers mad at me)
- add red pepper flakes & a bit of chili oil and make chicken or shrimp fra diavolo 
- reduce sauce (likely with a tailored spice mix) more and put on pizza dough (make or buy if in a hurry) + get easy toppings
