ingred prep:

- 1 large whole can tomatoes (i usually hand blend for curry)
- 1 large onion
- a few tbsp of either diced ginger or Gourmet Garden Ginger Cold Blended Paste (don't judge ;-)
- garlic (personal pref again)
- rly good buttery olive oil, ghee or safflower oil
- a curry powder blend you like or make
- garam masala
- good chicken/beef/veg stock AND/OR plain yogurt (see below)
- salt (fresh cracked globally sourced rocky salt or morton's coarse kosher)
- pepper (fresh cracked)
- sweetenter to taste if desired (i try to use a gd enough wine to avoid this but use agave to taste)

prep:

- puree together in a food processor onion, ginger and garlic (if using)
- heat a few tbsp of the fat on medium
- add puree to the fat and caramelize
- slightly lower heat and stir in curry powder, heating through for 2-3m
- add tomatoes, bring back to temp
- for thinner curry use stock, for richer (or specific flavor profile desire) use yogurt (it's a keep adding a little at a time and taste + eyeball kind of thing)

That's a base. You can mix it up for diversity with diff curry blends and adding in 1-2lbs of various cubed meats or chickpea+veg combo.

- simmer for 25m
- add 1-2tbsp of garam masala
- adjust salt/pepper/sweet/liquid
- simmer for 15m more

serve w/basmati rice, salad & naan.

- add 1-2lbs of meat or a chickpea+veg combo
